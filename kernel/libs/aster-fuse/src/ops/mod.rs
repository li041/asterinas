//! Per-operation FUSE request/reply definitions and encoders.
//!
//! Each submodule corresponds to one FUSE operation and owns both the on-wire
//! structures and the `FuseOperation` implementation used to serialize a
//! request and parse its reply. Types shared across operations (headers,
//! `Attr`, `EntryOut`, directory entries) live in the crate root.
//!
//! Operation payload types follow the FUSE protocol direction suffixes: `In`
//! means a request payload sent to the server, and `Out` means a reply payload
//! returned by the server.
//!
//! Operation wrapper types use the `Operation` suffix and implement [`crate::FuseOperation`].
